VIK
===

VIK is a GUI development library.

The main objective of VIK is to provide the implementation of an inherently fault tolerant framework for graphical application development.

Some features include

- Separation of visual elements to multiple OS processes
- OpenGL rasterization
- Novel methods for subpixel rendering
- Vectorised font rendering (Multi-channel signed distance fields)
- Build-in support for animation of any visual element of the interface.

VIK is currently in an experimental and unstable development stage.
Once it is sufficiently stable, it will be made public.
